EFFECT OF THRUSTER UNCERTAINTIES ON A DEEP SPACE MISSION USING ELECTRIC PROPULSION

Description:
This repository contains Python scripts developed as part of my thesis on electric propulsion thruster analysis and uncertainty propagation. The scripts are designed to perform various analyses related to electric propulsion thrusters and to propagate uncertainties through the analysis process.
